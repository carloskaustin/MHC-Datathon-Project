# 🚍 NYC Bus Violation Impact Analysis
## 📖 Project Overview

- This project was developed as part of the MHC++ Datathon, a competition focused on data-driven solutions to real-world problems. Our team analyzed MTA Bus Automated Camera Enforcement (ACE) violation data and bus speed data to understand how different types of traffic violations impact travel times and delays.

## 🏙️ Background

- The Automated Camera Enforcement (ACE) program is used by the MTA to monitor traffic violations that disrupt bus operations. ACE cameras automatically detect vehicles committing violations and issue fines.

- Initial Fine: $50 for a first violation

- Uniform Fines: All violations result in the same penalty, regardless of impact.

- Main Violation Types:

  - Bus lane violations – vehicles blocking or driving in bus-only lanes.

  - Bus stop violations – vehicles obstructing designated bus stops.

  - Double parking violations – vehicles blocking traffic by parking illegally alongside another vehicle.

## ❓ Research Questions

- Should all fines cost the same amount?

- Do some violations affect travel time more than others?

## 📊 Datasets

We combined violation data with bus route segment travel times to measure the effect of traffic violations on average travel time.

- [MTA Bus Automated Camera Enforcement Violations: Beginning 2019](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Bus-Automated-Camera-Enforcement-Violations-Be/kh8p-hcbm/data_preview)

  - Contains records of traffic violations (bus lane, double parked, bus stop blockages) captured by ACE cameras dating back to 2019.

- [MTA Bus Route Segment Speeds: Beginning 2025](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Bus-Route-Segment-Speeds-Beginning-2025/kufs-yh3x/data_preview)

  - Historical dataset of bus segment speed and travel times for 2025.

- [MTA Bus Route Segment Speeds: 2023–2024](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Bus-Route-Segment-Speeds-2023-2024/58t6-89vi/about_data)

- Historical dataset of bus segment speeds and travel times for 2023–2024.

## 🛠️ Methods

- Tools Used:

  - Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

  - Jupyter Notebook for analysis

  - Microsoft PowerPoint for presenting findings

- Steps:

  1. Cleaned and merged datasets by stop ID, route, date, and hour.

  2. Computed average travel times across segments for each violation type.

  3. Built bar charts and a pie chart in Python to visualize violation frequency and impact.

  4. Designed a PowerPoint presentation to communicate insights and recommendations.

## 🔑 Key Findings

- Bus lane violations added about 5 minutes per segment at certain violation counts, making them the most impactful violation type.

- Even small per-segment delays compound across full bus routes, affecting thousands of riders daily.

- Current fines ($50 first offense) are uniform, but findings suggest some violations (like bus lane blockages) have disproportionately higher impacts — raising the question of whether fines should vary by violation type.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- The analysis could not fully isolate each violation type by holding the other two at zero. For example, bus-lane violations were not measured independently of bus-stop and double-parked violations, so overlap may influence the observed delays.

## 💡 Business Recommendations

- Reevaluate Fine Structures: 

  - Consider differentiated fines that reflect the severity of travel time impact.

- Public Communication Campaigns:

  - Share statistics with the public showing how violations slow buses for thousands of riders.

  - Example message: “Bus lane violations have the potential to double travel time for NYC buses.”

- Deterrence Campaigns:

  - Highlight fines and reinforce enforcement efforts.

  - Use data-driven messaging to shift driver behavior.

## 📈 Visuals

- Bar chart: violation counts vs. average travel time per segment.

- Pie chart: proportion of violations by type.

- Selected charts integrated into a PowerPoint slide deck for final presentation.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

1. Understand the dataset deeply by studying the data dictionary 

    - Use the data dictionary to confirm exactly what each column represents (definitions, units, valid values).

2. Don’t get stuck on one idea.

    - Be willing to pivot from you original idea or ask new questions as patterns emerge. An iterating process allows for clearer research questions and more actionable findings.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Develop a pricing model to adequately match fine amounts to the level of delay each violation type causes for NYC buses.

- Create communication and deterrence campaigns to inform citizens how violations can slow down buses for thousands of NYC riders
